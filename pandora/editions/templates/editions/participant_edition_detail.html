                        <p>
                            Pandora is a five-day puzzle hunt on the campus of the University of Twente by Inter-Actief
                            members. Solving puzzles in teams and
                            killing off members of rivaling teams grants a certain amount of points. Every evening a meeting
                            will take place on campus in which
                            information is provided to aid your quest. In addition, the story (which relates to the
                            edition's theme) progresses every time through
                            acting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Participants of Pandora receive a range of weapons from the organization, which can be used to
                            take care of
                            opponents (fellow participants). Furthermore, participants have to solve puzzles with the hints
                            that are hidden all over campus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first meeting (after which Pandora will take off) always takes place on the Monday evening.
                            The location and time will be timely
                            announced by the organization. There is a participation fee which is used to finance weapons,
                            among others. Before Pandora, the theme
                            and committee will be revealed during the Pandora Hype Drink. During this drink registration
                            opens, and you can participate in the
                            pregame. The pregame is a warming-up for Pandora, a game which differs from year to year.

                                Participation in Pandora will definitely bring you a week packed with excitement, mystery,
                                paranoia and action! It's also full-time,
                                as you are never safe. Whether you are attending lectures, walking in the Coop or laying in
                                bed, danger is right around the
                                corner(and a hostile housemate oftentimes as well!).

                            Pandora has been around for years, and thus has a rich history. It is one of the oldest events hosted by Inter-Actief.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The archived editions exist since 2014 and convey information about earlier Pandora editions.
                            Little is known about the older editions.
                            Before 2017, Pandora was held in Dutch and thus the archive about editions earlier than 2017 will be in Dutch.
                            If you happen to have information regarding earlier Pandora editions, please
                            <a href="{% url 'committee' year=latest_edition.year %}">contact the current committee</a> or send a mail to
                            <a href="mailto:contact@inter-actief.net">contact@inter-actief.net</a> if no committee has been appointed yet.
